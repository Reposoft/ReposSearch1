There should be primitive events based on the status letter, see
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.ref.svnlook.c.changed.html.
onAdd (with copy-from info)
onDelete
onChange
onPropChange
onChangeAndPropChange

And a first level of derived events
propertyChanged (new or modified, with diff)
propertyDeleted (each property name)
contentChanged (including add from copy and parent folder copy)
contentDeleted (including parent folder deleted)
propertyOrContentChanged (needed for fulltext indexing in svnhead)

Or is it better with fewer methods but change objects that are possibly empty?
onAdd
onChange (always called after onAdd)
onDelete (including parent folder delete, with content and properties object for previous release)

Maybe interpret the change letters in the change handler base class?
